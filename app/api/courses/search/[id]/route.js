                                                                                         ^
                                                                                         |
                                                                                         |
                                                                            Where this is the "id" and the folder naming conventions should be like this [id] // Folder Name
                                                                                                                                                          |
                                                                                                                                                          |___ route.js

    Below is the method to get that ID from the folder naming convention in Next Js 13 - beta

    for example ---> http://localhost:3000/api/courses/search/6
                                                              ^
                                                              |
                                                              |
                                    This is the Param we need to fetch, this can be handy in many cases where we want to show
                                    or fetch some data on a sepcific value
